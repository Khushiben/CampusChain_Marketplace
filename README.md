# CampusChain_Marketplace
Decentralized College Marketplace is a Web3 dApp for students to securely list, buy, and sell items within their campus. Using blockchain, ownership is transparent, payments are crypto-secured, and transactions are peer-to-peer, making it a student-focused, decentralized version of OLX.
